# SPECs
The initial idea of this project. And We can discuss spec and features list here.

# I Would Like to Announce A New Project on Going for A Tokens Sharing Network.

Even though we call it a network, which is inspired by [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) for learning people to learn and use Javascript, we want to build a sandbox for people to create and share their tokens as easy as possible. It could be used as a tokens app or even a wallet without any line of code as well. By using this platform, people can easily and fully access the tokens they create on the blockchain and using that to build a brand new era of the digital economy globally.

What is a new digital economy? what it may change and impact our daily life? Almost everything happen in our life are gradually moving to Internet and kill so many businesses or products in the real world in these couple decades, except “Money” and “Banks” for example, the fundamental exchange of our works and living, and its middle mans, such as the banks or the governments. The major reason for these exceptions is because they are the only thing or people we can trust so for in the real world. 

Before the blockchain technology is proven working by Bitcoin since 2009, we have no way to shift the major part of our life, “money” or “value”,  to the Internet, because we can not easily trust anyone, any third party or any website on the Internet without really knowing each other and doing the payments really virtually on the Internet (All our current payment systems still go though some banks or the credit cards network.) We usually call it “the last mile problem” in telecommunication. Now, we would like to to solve this same problem for the “Internet of Trust.” We are going to implement a sandbox (or a platform as a service) online for people to experience theirs daily use tokens.


This is how we are going to do,


1. We are going to provide a platform on top of a public blockchain network for people to create, use, transfer, or exchange their own tokens for their daily life.
2. We are going to give away everyone who uses this platform some coins or tokens initially for creating or transferring their tokens at very beginning. Basically, after that, they will use their tokens to do all other things, and exchange tokens with anyone in the world for credits, assets, value, or works. 

     <Remark: On any current blockchain network, you have to pay some coins or tokens to execute a smart contract (a program what runs on a blockchain), so we want to give you some free tokens to get started.>
     

3. You can easily use this platform to create and deploy your websites or apps for any purpose to fully utilize your tokens. API for developers to interact with your tokens will be provided for further applications development as well.
4. And it will be a 100% open source.


What we are not going to do.


1. We are not going to do an ICO.
2. We are not going to centralize any service or any platform on purpose. Even though there are some tools or service may be hosted by us, yet they are just an interface for easy to use only. All your tokens, smart contracts, and their transactions are still on the blockchain we deploy to, and the webs or apps are still owned by yourself, by the users.
3. We are not going to do KYC, and not going to use any of your data to do the AI stuff.



PS. Any sponsor or developer who wants to join or support this project, please contact me, Ming-der Wang <mingderwang@gmail.com> or @mingderwang on twitter.

In May, 2018, we are working on the first phase to design the whole architecture and define the core functions on papers. Any recommendations or feedback will be very welcome.
